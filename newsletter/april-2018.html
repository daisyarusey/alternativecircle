			<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 52px; font-weight: 900;">CEO'S NOTE</h2>
			
			
			<p>It has been two years since I co-founded Alternative Circle and it has been one hell of a ride. We have just relaunched the app to an exclusive few, to retest the features end to end and I'm confident our product will compete well. Let me share few lessons about my experience:</p>

<p>1.  Can one be a non-tech founder ? - It is very difficult to be a non-tech founder and to run a tech company. I had to take numerous online courses just to understand basic terminologies, concepts and well, tech. I found out the word "tech" was completely misunderstood. I found out that software developers did not do the same thing and that good software developers had been employed by the best since their skills are highly sought after. Luckily, in this age of connectivity, platforms like Youtube provided a window into Standford, Yale and Havard classrooms that would never have been available 4 years ago.</p>

<p>2. Out-sourcing Build Vs. Internal Build - Outsourcing someone to build your app or solution is okay to a certain point. You must build a strong internal engineering team. The challenges apps face need real time monitoring and iterations so that the customer experience is smooth and uninterrupted. With time, outsourcing becomes expensive and unsustainable. A good internal engineering team - although expensive, is a worthwhile investment.</p>

<p>3. Competitions - Be very careful about competitions. Some are in existence for the sake of promoting their own brands. I have learnt that if a competition requires you to pay for anything, that means that it might not be worth it. The other thing I have learnt is that there are "Compreneurs" who have mastered the art of winning competitions but do not deliver any value. The money is still attractive particularly for those of us who come from eco-systems that are starved of capital. That being said, these conferences offer unique opportunities to meet people from the same industry in different markets and one can share notes and experiences and adopt them into your business. Big investors rarely come to these competitions but their networks usually do - and if you impress one enough they usually make very relevant introductions. I used my experience to LEARN! LEARN! LEARN! I needed to see the competition was like out there and what different start-ups in evolved eco-systems were doing better than us. These experiences have made me a better public speaker and presenter. Therefore all the stage time and panels I have sat on have got me to a point where I am more confident in my ability to answer questions and keep a crowd engaged.</p>

<p>4. Customer comes first - Always talk to your initial customers. They offer invaluable insights as to why they use your product, they give honest feedback in comparison to your competitors and suggest what new features can make their experience better. Your customers are the most important stakeholders in the business and if you do not have a mechanism to listen and engage them about the product, it will be very difficult to stay in business.</p>

<p>5. Get good investors - This is a tough topic in markets that have little access to capital. A good investor is anyone who wants to see you succeed. Venture Capital Institutions in Kenya and in emerging markets in general are usually run by people who have never done a successful VC deal. This in turn means they are also learning with you and are incapable of mentoring you since they tend to focus on monetization of features before the features are perfected. We were very fortunate because our investors (CreditInfo) had an entrepreneur as their CEO and he understood that we needed to  be shielded from the "corporateness" of his much larger institution. He provided a mentor, who talks to me every day and this has made me very close to him. The sole purpose of your venture capital partner is mentoring. Money is one part of the equation. My mentor has connected me to global leaders, bank CEOs, data scientists and many more invaluable networks. Some are even beyond my wildest dreams! I consider this as the best decision I ever made in business so far. I have 3 mentors who are all directors, and I can honestly say they are the reason we are still here. The words, " Don't give up yet, Kevin!" from someone I respect and admire does more for morale than any amount of money will ever do.</p>

<p>6. Everyone is shooting in the dark  - One of my mentors, and my team insisted that I go to Silicon Valley to network, and what I found out blew my mind! Failure is good! If you fear failure, then you have no business being in the app business!</p>
<p>No one has won this game yet . Think Instagram - they started a photo sharing app after Facebook had launched photos on their platform and other photo sharing apps like Flickr were gaining significant traction. Instagram still made significant progress to be one of the largest and most loved photo sharing apps in the world.
A well run start-up never fails, their initial products may fail, but the start-up itself does not. Myspace got beat by FaceBook, but it is still in existence and now serves a very niche customer base. A well run start-up pivots.</p>
<p>If you do not have haters, you are doing something wrong. 99% of the time you will fail. The reality is that, if you believe in a hypotheses and continue working on it, the data and customers will tell you whether the feature works. If it fails, learn from the failure and figure out why, and talk to the customers for more insight.
COLLABORATE COLLABORATE COLLABORATE. If you are not collaborating in the tech space, you will most certainly fail. Most tech start-ups are solving unique problems, and the only way to scale is by partnering. This relates to banks which will be unable to build great solutions if they do not partner with the right Fintechs currently. If they do not do this now, they might be unable to negotiate the most favorable terms for the partnerships in the future. MPESA for example looked for banking partners for the longest time in 2006-2007. Three years later, the same banks had to integrate with MPESA or risk losing significant retail presence.</p>
<p>Those are the main takeaways from the last two years running a Fintech Start-up in Kenya. I am glad to say that with all these lessons, some banks are looking to partner with us (finally) and I am confident that in a year or so, we will be a dominant player in the mobile app space. Engage with me on twitter @KevinMutiso for more lessons and thoughts from me. I'll answer all your questions as best as I can.</p>

<p>In my first 6 months at AC, I have been fortunate enough to experience first-hand, what goes into a project, the general planning process, development and completion; as well, as how much work and detail goes into every stage.  This has been eye opening for me in the design world and I got to also learn the different roles I have to play as a graphic designer.</p>
<p>When I started off as an intern, I was immersed into a group of open-minded intellectuals, who were accepting of my suggestions and ideas. This instantly made me feel comfortable and part of the AC family.  My first week was overwhelming but my supervisor held my hand and saw me through those first weeks through his guidance and expertise. I managed to pick up tips and skills that have recently made my work much easier. I feel like the first grueling weeks paid off since I was offered a job as a Junior Graphic Designer!</p>
