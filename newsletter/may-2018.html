			<p>We have been lending for a full week with no glitches on the app side and the system side. This is a massive improvement from the last two times we tried to launch and fortunately so far we have not yet detected any potential hacking.</p>

<p>Interestingly this time the problem is slightly different and we have a reduced number of loans issued per day due to some of the business decisions we took. Namely;</p>
<ol>
	<li>We shall not lend to GREEN AND BRONZE customers,</li>
	<li>We shall lend not more than Kes 500k per day until we have finalized with the lending pool</li>
</ol>

<p>This may seem counter-intuitive but as a team we have learnt from our past mistakes. I'd like to remind all that a majority of the initial downloads were trying to game the system and we learnt this the hard way.</p>

<p>As a result we have started working on new features and the first feature will be a personalized user generated content feature that will look like a "NEWS" app initially. The main difference will be that we will not feature ads and we shall try to use minimal data. We are trying to make the content addictive not annoying.</p>

<p>The other key thing (this is in keeping with the value of Truth that AC aspires to espouse) is that several of you have received job offers from other businesses and some of them have been tempting for some of you. I want to make one thing clear. Before every one of you joined, we had a tea or a coffee together and I mentioned 3 things;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Be an asset not a liability.</li>
	<li>Align personal goals to the company's goals.</li>
	<li>Mediocre is easy; aspire for excellence.</li>
</ol>

<p>I made these requests to each and every one of you and soon enough, you will be noticed by others. It has not come as a surprise that you are being admired for your work and diligence. Furthermore we are in an exciting field and the next few years will be super exciting. As a word of caution as your leader, the vast sums of money you will be offered will be great, but be sure that in whatever you do, your future earnings and legacy will not be inhibited. The reason I know that some of you are getting job offers, is because I too have received some very lucrative ones. If you do get an offer, Ben and his team are on hand tomorrow to advise you on how best to move forward. HR is here for your benefit and what we want to achieve at AC is prosperity for all. If you feel that you would like to approach me directly, kindly whatsapp me or call me, my door is always open for you guys. </p>


<p>June is here. Let the journey continue.</p>

			<p>One Year In ....</p>

<p>It didn't dawn on me that it had already been a year since I joined Alternative Circle until I started receiving congratulation messages through my LinkedIn account. Time really flew and then again it does so when you are enjoying what you do.</p>
<p>Today, I want to take a minute to just look back at how far we have come as Alternative Circle but specifically the Customer Service Department. We have grown from a team of one to a take charge, head strong and vibrant group of three. Being the company's front line hasn't been easy given the ups and downs we have received throughout the year but from dawn to dusk we have embraced challenges with grace, kindness and most of all patience.</p>
<p>I would like to end this short message by thanking all the people who have brightened my smile and who made a heavy load lighter. To my team, Grace and Yolander, thank you for your dedication to making every clients experience better every day. To the other departments, thank you for answering all our 1000 questions at all hours of the day and for walking with us every day on this journey to put the customer first.</p>
<p>.... Onwards and upwards ....</p>
