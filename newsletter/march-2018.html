			<p>This edition is very special to me. It has been two years since we started AC. I walked in to the Foundry Co-Working Space and I had my first meeting. I remember the anxiety, I felt. It was mind-numbing. I had a 7 year old daughter who was in school, I had very little cash and a dream, BUT IT had to be done!</p>

<p>Two years later, I have a 9 year old daughter who is still in school, a team of 16 an app that works, with over 25,000 downloads. We have had two key members leave the team. We have raised USD 1,155,000. We have won 5 Global Awards and we are now raising capital for growth! They say one must count their blessings and we do.</p>

<p>The irony is that we still have challenges that may seem insurmountable. And I always think back to that day April 1st 2016 when even an app was non-existent and realize that execution is key. What matters is that we execute and if we encounter pitfalls, we must then be clever and seek counsel and advise on how best to deal with the problem.</p>

<p>EXECUTE, because all that matters are RESULTS!!!!!!</p>

			<p style="margin: 5px 0; padding: 0; font-weight: 400"><i>Life after AC - By Barry Mitoko</i></p>

<p>Life at AC seemed normal only up until I went back to school and realized that I probably had the best internship experience than of any of my classmates.
I spent 3 months in AC but gained 3 years' worth of wisdom. My time as an intern at Alternative Circle has put me ahead of the curve.  It wasn't just about Fintech but so much more.  I got to experience the beauty of being immersed in a project to the point where I found myself putting in extra time to make sure every detail of my work was perfect, an element that has become ingrained in my mentality to the point now where I now hold myself to higher standards. Before my time at Alternative Circle I was satisfied with just completing a bachelor's degree but I was so encouraged by watching various individuals in AC pursuing their post graduate studies and seeing the value in their perceptions, in their work, and in their presence that I also have decided that my journey with education will not come to an end after my bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>I didn't just improve on how I make presentations I also learned how to better present myself.  To use my height and build that is associated with leadership and power as a 'superpower' that commands attention and respect.</p>  
<p>Before my experience at AC my eyes were not open to the possibility of matching up against the best in the world or being a global leader, but AC has proven that we can hold our own with the best companies in the world, I no longer think of just harnessing opportunities in Kenya but I believe that global ascendancy is tangible and within my grasp.</p>

<p>I am very grateful for being welcomed into the Alternative Circle family and the warmth I received during the experience and I look forward to returning as a more developed individual.</p>
