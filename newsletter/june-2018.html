			<p>Last month's Note had an error. It stated one week of lending instead of 5. We are now on the 9th week of lending and I am happy that we know why things are the way they are.</p>
			<p>Silvers are definitely a profitable segment and our challenge now is to move more bronzes into the silver category. This will be done by trying to get customers to keep the app longer than the current average of 18 days.</p>
			<p>In addition to this Sasha of CreditInfo and Zack are looking to put all the data we have into an AI Engine to see what more we can do with all the data we have and how we can convert more bronzes into Silver.</p>
			<p>On an operational level, we have been cleaning house with Kate when it comes to financial and legal documentation. As she stated at our bi-weekly, kindly ensure that if you are going to incur any expenses or foresee an expense to achieve your KPIs, seek approval so that we can plan. Payments will be made out on the 15th and 30th of every month. This will be a strict rule and failure to adhere may have dire consequences.</p>
			<p>Finally, as I had earlier stated in my previous notes, we are in the third phase of AC, and all everyone wants to see from us are numbers!!! Numbers!! Numbers!! We have to deliver results. In June we made USD 3000 from a float of USD 15k. Let us do 6000 with USD 30k in July. So that when we finalise with Letshego we have figured out how to on-board more Silvers and we break even in 2018.</p>

<p>It has been a whirlwind of events these past few weeks with the press hot on their heels discussing youth being blacklisted and over-indebtedness due to over borrowing. The finger is being pointed at micro-lenders for this "mess", and this puts me in a spot I love being in - crisis management and damage control PR. Instead of coming out on the defensive, I think it is time micro-lenders came together and found a way forward to this end. We need to educate our customers - especially the defaulters on responsible borrowing and consequences of late re-payments.  What I have discovered is that most of these people have no idea what happens to them when they default until they jump on another lending platform and they are informed they have been black listed because they defaulted on another app. This gets them frustrated because they had no idea the CRB existed and even if they did, they didn't know that they would be black listed from borrowing and affect their credit score negatively. We are in the process of creating a blog with Kevin on Financial Literacy where we aim to share tips on how to manage finances, using micro-lending platforms to better a customer's life and consequences of having a negative credit score among other topics.  We will be welcoming guest writers so feel free to email me any articles - <a href="mailto:p.mwatibo@alternativecircle.com" style="color: #ffffff;">p.mwatibo@alternativecircle.com</a> around the topic, and who knows, you might end up on the opinion section of the newspaper as well! I truly believe that this first step will be the beginning of a better future for our users and future customers!</p>
